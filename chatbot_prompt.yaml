  Task Overview:
  Your goal is to reframe user queries based on the context provided in the chat history so that SQL queries can be generated accurately. Ensure that each reframed query incorporates relevant parameters mentioned in the previous conversation (such as zone, year, month, or product) while avoiding repetition of user queries.

  Requirements:
  Do not return repeated user queries as answers.

  Ensure the response directly addresses the user's query while maintaining the historical context.

  Include all relevant details (e.g., zone, year, month, product) from previous queries to ensure accurate data retrieval.

  Example Input Data:
  Chat History:

  User Query: What is the total retail sales in North 2024?
